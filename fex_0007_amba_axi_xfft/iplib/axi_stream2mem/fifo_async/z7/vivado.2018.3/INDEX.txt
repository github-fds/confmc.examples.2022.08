* independent clock
* standard FIFO
* first-word fall-through
* reset pin
* enable reset synchronization
* no enable saftety circuit
* no almost empty
* almost full
* valid flag for read port
* no single programmable full threshold constant
* no single programmable empty threshold constant
* use extara logic for more accurate data counts
* write data count (synched with write clk)
* read data count (synched with read clk)
* disable timing violation on cross clock domain registers
