### 1.1 CON-FMC software package
This example requires CON-FMC software package.
If CON-FMC SW pkg is installed on */opt/confmc/2020.06*,
then source following script.
If not, install it that is available from <a href="https://github.com/github-fds/confmc.x86_64.linux.2020.06" target="_blank">here</a>
(The directory should reflect actual one.)

    $ source /opt/confmc/2020.06/setting.sh

### 1.2 Xilinx development package
This example requires Xilinx development package; Vivado or ISE depending on FPGA type.

#### 1.2.1 Xilinx Vivado
If Xilinx Vivado pkg is installed on */opt/Xilinx/Vivado/2018.3* or */tools/Xilinx/Vivado/2022.1*,
then source following script.

    $ source /opt/Xilinx/Vivado/2018.3/settings64.sh
    or
    $ source /tools/Xilinx/Vivado/2022.1/settings64.sh

When Avnet ZedBoard is used, License Free Version called *Vivado WebPack* will be fine, which
is now called *Vivado ML Standard Edition*.
It is available from <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html" target="_blank">here</a>
and Xilinx account is required to get it.

#### 1.2.2 Xilinx ISE
If Xilinx ISE pkg is installed on */opt/Xilinx/14.7*,
then source following script.

    $ source /opt/Xilinx/14.7/ISE_DS/settings64.sh

### 1.3 HDL simulator
This example uses one of following HDL simulators to run simulation.
* Xilinx Vivado Simulator (xsim): It is included in the Vivado package. (Use this for the project)
* Icarus Verilog: It is open-source version, but it may have problem to deal with Xilinx FPGA specific primitives.
* Any industry standard HDL simulator such as Mentor Graphics ModelSim or QuestaSim.

### 1.4 LibUsb
The CON-FMC pkg uses LibUSB package and it can be checked as follows.

    $ ldconfig -p | grep libusb
    (standard input):	libusbmuxd.so.4 (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libusbmuxd.so.4
    (standard input):	libusb-1.0.so.0 (libc6,x86-64) => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libusb-1.0.so.0
    (standard input):	libusb-1.0.so (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libusb-1.0.so

If it is not installed, install it as follows.

    $ sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0.0-dev

### 1.5 Zedboard Board files

This example assumes that you are using Zedboard. Before proceeding below contents, you will need to install\
Zedboard board files into where `Vivado` is installed. You can get the files and instructions how to install them from [Install Digiletn's Board Files](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/guides/install-board-files)

# 2. Internal design
Following picture shows a rough structure of the design.

![Internal structure](./doc/images/amba_axi_mem-block.png "Internal structure")

Host program generates AMBA AXI bus transactions on the bus in the FPGA, where
the host program can be written in C/C++ or Python.

# 3. Prepare IP
This example uses following module.

  * mem_axi: Simple memory with AMBA AXI interface.

<details><summary>Click to expand</summary>

This step requires Xilinx package and you should reflect the correct version if the version is not *2018.3*.

This step uses Avnet ZedBoard and you should reflect the correct one if the board is not the same.
The ZedBoard has Zynq7000 series FPGA and 'z7' indicates FPGA type Zynq7000.

### 3.1 mem_axi
It is a memory with AMBA AXI utilizing Xilinx dual-port BRAM.
This example uses 8Kbyte size of memory.

  1. go to 'iplib/mem_axi/bram_simple_dual_port' directory<br />
     ```
     $ cd iplib/mem_axi/bram_simple_dual_port
     ```
  2. further down to sub-directory implying FPGA type<br />
     ```
     $ cd z7
     ```
  3. further down to sub-directory for version of Xilinx package<br />
     ```
     $ cd vivado.2018.3
     ```
  4. run 'make'<br />
     ```
     $ make
     ```
The 'make' takes time and prepares all necessary Xilinx dual-port BRAM.
You can change memory size as follows.

* Change 'MEM_SIZE" macro in 'hw.single/design/verilog/fpga.v'
    * It will be 8\*1024, i.e, 8Kbyte.
* Prepare dual-port bram if not ready
    * iplib/mem_axi/bram_simple_dual_port
* Add corresponding code in the 'mem_axi'
    * iplib/mem_axi/rtl/verilog/bram_axi.v
* Verify your design using simulator
* Add corresponding XCI
    * hw.single/pnr/vivado.zed.lpc/vivado_run.tcl
* Run synthesis and implementation.
